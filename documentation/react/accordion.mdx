# Tailwind CSS Accordion - React

Use our Tailwind CSS <Code>Accordion</Code> component to allow the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

See below our simple and versatile <Code>Accordion</Code> example that you can use in your React and Tailwind CSS projects. We also included some <Code>Accordion</Code> props that are available.

<br />

<State initialState={{ active: 1 }}>
  <ComponentDemo id="accordion">
    <Observe>
      {({ setState, active }) => (
        <>
          <Accordion open={active === 1}>
            <AccordionHeader
