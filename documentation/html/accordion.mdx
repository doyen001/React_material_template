# Tailwind CSS Accordion

Use our Tailwind CSS accordion component to allow the user to show and hide sections of related content on a page. There are many ways to use this component, like displaying a list of FAQs, showing various menus and submenus, displaying the locations of a particular company, and so on.

See below our simple and versatile accordion example that you can use in your Tailwind CSS projects. We also included some accordion props that are available.

To use an accordion example that has items expanded, add the <Code html html>.open</Code> class on the <Code html html>.collapse</Code> `<div>`.

          We're not always in the position that we want to be at. We're
          constantly growing. We're constantly making mistakes. We're constantly
          trying to express ourselves and actualize our dreams. If you have the
          opportunity to play this game of life you need to appreciate every
          moment. A lot of people don't appreciate the moment until it's passed.

          It really matters and then like it really doesn't matter. What matters
          is the people who are sparked by it. And the people who are like
          offended by it, it doesn't matter. Because it's about motivating the
          doers. Because I'm here to follow my dreams and inspire other people
          to follow their dreams, too.

          The time is now for it to be okay to be great. People in this world
          shun people for being great. For being a bright color. For standing
          out. But the time is now to be okay to be the greatest you. Would you
          believe in what you believe in, if you were the only one who believed
          it? If everything I did failed - which it doesn't, it actually
          succeeds - just the fact that I'm willing to fail is an inspiration.
          People are so scared to lose that they don't even try. Like, one thing
          people can't say is that I'm not trying, and I'm not trying my
          hardest, and I'm not trying to do the best way I know how.

## Required Scrips

<span id="required-script" className="scroll-mt-56" />

The accordion component needs a required script file to work, you just need to add the below script file to the bottom of your html file.

```html
<!-- from node_modules -->
<script src="node_modules/@material-tailwind/html/scripts/collapse.js"></script>

<!-- from cdn -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@material-tailwind/html@latest/scripts/collapse.js"></script>
```
